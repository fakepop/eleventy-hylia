One of my personal goals is to be present in the moment and make the best—whatever this may mean—of what I am engaged in. In this post, I am sharing some of my initial experiments with the Pomodoro technique.

Some of you may already be familiar with the [Pomodoro technique](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18482790-the-pomodoro-technique). Essentially, it is a time management method centered around timeboxing and interruptions handling.

Without going into too much of the specifics, pomodoros are the basic units of the method. A pomodoro is a 25-minute focused uninterrupted work sprint. Each pomodoro is followed by a short break (2-3 minutes), except for every fourth, which calls for longer breaks.

I have been using this method at work for a few months now. Initially, it was useful for tackling parts of my work I didn’t enjoy and that I kept delaying. It provided me with an opportunity to sprint through these tasks, with a clear end is sight (whether the end of the pomodoro or the completion of the task), and made the work more bearable and easier to complete.

Over time, I extended the use of technique to other areas of my work to using it on a regular basis (meetings are often hard to fit it). Like with most methods and frameworks, I have taken what’s useful to me and leave behind aspects that I already have a grasp on in some other way.

More recently, I got curious about extending the power of uninterrupted timeboxing to other areas of my life. It started with listening to music. Often, I pick an album with the intention, for the duration of a pomodoro, to truly listen and intently focus on being present to the music. During the process, every time I get interrupted—almost inevitably by my own thoughts—I add a “mark” in my interruption journal. 

I have very recently picked up daily writing. I am experimenting with using the length of a pomodoro to create a single piece of content, like this one. During this period, I try to maintain my writing as fluid as possible, focusing on the core of the idea I am trying to convey, and not worrying too much about offshoots and adjacent topics, grammar, typos, style, etc. The subsequent pomodoro is dedicated to editing.

I am now considering timeboxing other activities in my life, to the extent that is possible and desirable. While this seems a bit burdensome, the idea remains to stay focused and present for a relatively short amount of time—what’s the average attention span again?—in the hope to be able extend it over time.
