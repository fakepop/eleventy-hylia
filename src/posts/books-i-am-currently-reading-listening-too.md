> On Books.

I often read (or listen) to multiple books at any given time. Interest and velocity vary greatly.

On the front burner:

* [Hot Thai Kitchen](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25733917-hot-thai-kitchen): Demystifying Thai Cuisine with Authentic Recipes to Make at Home by local Vancouverite [Pailin Chongchitnant](https://www.youtube.com/pailinskitchen/). A few years ago, [Steven Forth](https://twitter.com/StevenForth) told me he always had a cookbook on his reading diet which inspired me to do so as well.
* [The Places That Scare You](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/136977.The_Places_That_Scare_You): A Guide to Fearlessness in Difficult Times by Pema Chödrön for a good dose of lively and grounding Buddhist precepts.
* [Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/84/84-h/84-h.htm) by Mary Wollstonecraft (Godwin) Shelley. I had very misplaced conception of what this whole Frankenstein story was about. It's an awesome tale of misunderstandings, narrow-mindedness, loss and suffering.
* [Triple Your Reading Speed](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/160074.Triple_Your_Reading_Speed) by Wade E. Cutler. This is a book that I got from the library and seeing how much of a practical book it is (exercises), I might have to get my own copy to be able to commit to working on increasing my reading speed.

On the back burner, I have a few books that I have started by somehow could quite finish. I still intend to do so, though.

* [Beyond Debt](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38923621-beyond-debt): Islamic Experiments in Global Finance by Daromir Rudnyckyj.
* [Confessions of the Pricing Man](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26784759-confessions-of-the-pricing-man): How Price Affects Everything by Hermann Simon.
* [How Brands Grow Part 2](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29283371-how-brands-grow-and-how-brands-grow-part-2) by Jenni Romaniuk, Byron Sharp
* [Social Selling Mastery](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31826056-social-selling-mastery): Scaling Up Your Sales and Marketing Machine for the Digital Buyer by Jamie Shanks
